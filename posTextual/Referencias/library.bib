abstract = {The only comprehensive guide to Kalman filtering and its applications to real-world GPS/INS problemsWritten by recognized authorities in the field, this book provides engineers, computer scientists, and others with a working familiarity with the theory and contemporary applications of Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Inertial Navigational Systems, and Kalman filters. Throughout, the focus is on solving real-world problems, with an emphasis on the effective use of state-of-the-art integration techniques for those systems, especially the application of Kalman filtering. To that end, the authors explore the various subtleties, common failures, and inherent limitations of the theory as it applies to real-world situations, and provide numerous detailed application examples and practice problems, including GPS-aided INS, modeling of gyros and accelerometers, and WAAS and LAAS. Drawing upon their many years of experience with GPS, INS, and the Kalman filter, the authors present numerous design and implementation techniques not found in other professional references, including original techniques for: * Representing the problem in a mathematical model * Analyzing the performance of the GPS sensor as a function of model parameters * Implementing the mechanization equations in numerically stable algorithms * Assessing computation requirements * Testing the validity of results * Monitoring GPS, INS, and Kalman filter performance in operationIn order to enhance comprehension of the subjects covered, the authors have included software in MATLAB, demonstrating the workings of the GPS, INS, and filter algorithms. In addition to showing the Kalman filter in action, the software also demonstrates various practical aspects of finite word length arithmetic and the need for alternative algorithms to preserve result accuracy.

abstract = {The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots shareâ€”the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.},

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots (AMR) are currently being introduced in many intralogistics operations, like manufacturing, warehousing, cross-docks, terminals, and hospitals. Their advanced hardware and control software allow autonomous operations in dynamic environments. Compared to an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system in which a central unit takes control of scheduling, routing, and dispatching decisions for all AGVs, AMRs can communicate and negotiate independently with other resources like machines and systems and thus decentralize the decision-making process. Decentralized decision-making allows the system to react dynamically to changes in the system state and environment. These developments have influenced the traditional methods and decision-making processes for planning and control. This study identifies and classifies research related to the planning and control of AMRs in intralogistics. We provide an extended literature review that highlights how AMR technological advances affect planning and control decisions. We contribute to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we propose an agenda for future research within this field.},

@techreport{Woodman2007,
abstract = {Until recently the weight and size of inertial sensors has prohibited their use in domains such as human motion capture. Recent improvements in the performance of small and lightweight micro-machined electromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors have made the application of inertial techniques to such problems possible. This has resulted in an increased interest in the topic of inertial navigation, however current introductions to the subject fail to sufficiently describe the error characteristics of inertial systems. We introduce inertial navigation, focusing on strapdown systems based on MEMS devices. A combination of measurement and simulation is used to explore the error characteristics of such systems. For a simple inertial navigation system (INS) based on the Xsens Mtx inertial measurement unit (IMU), we show that the average error in position grows to over 150 m after 60 seconds of operation. The propagation of orientation errors caused by noise perturbing gyroscope signals is identified as the critical cause of such drift. By simulation we examine the significance of individual noise processes perturbing the gyroscope signals, identifying white noise as the process which contributes most to the overall drift of the system. Sensor fusion and domain specific constraints can be used to reduce drift in INSs. For an example INS we show that sensor fusion using magnetometers can reduce the average error in position obtained by the system after 60 seconds from over 150 m to around 5 m. We conclude that whilst MEMS IMU technology is rapidly improving, it is not yet possible to build a MEMS based INS which gives sub-meter position accuracy for more than one minute of operation.},

@article{Lu1997,
abstract = {A robot exploring an unknown environment may need to build a world model from sensor measurements. In order to integrate all the frames of sensor data, it is essential to align the data properly. An incremental approach has been typically used in the past, in which each local frame of data is aligned to a cumulative global model, and then merged to the model. Because different parts of the model are updated independently while there are errors in the registration, such an approach may result in an inconsistent model. In this paper, we study the problem of consistent registration of multiple frames of measurements (range scans), together with the related issues of representation and manipulation of spatial uncertainties. Our approach is to maintain all the local frames of data as well as the relative spatial relationships between local frames. These spatial relationships are modeled as random variables and are derived from matching pairwise scans or from odometry. Then we formulate a procedure based on the maximum likelihood criterion to optimally combine all the spatial relations. Consistency is achieved by using all the spatial relations as constraints to solve for the data frame poses simultaneously. Experiments with both simulated and real data will be presented.},

abstract = {A dynamical extension that makes possible the integration of a kinematic controller and a torque controller for nonholonomic mobile robots is presented. A combined kinematic/torque control law is developed using backstepping, and asymptotic stability is guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Moreover, this control algorithm can be applied to the three basic nonholonomic navigation problems: tracking a reference trajectory, path following, and stabilization about a desired posture. The result is a general structure for controlling a mobile robot that can accommodate different control techniques, ranging from a conventional computed-torque controller, when all dynamics are known, to robust-adaptive controllers if this is not the case. A robust-adaptive controller based on neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this work. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and/or unstructured unmodeled dynamics in the vehicle. On-line NN weight tuning algorithms that do not require off-line learning yet guarantee small tracking errors and bounded control signals are utilized.},

They can be distinguished from other robots by their ability to move autonomously, with enough intelligence to react and make decisions based on the perception they receive from the environment. Mobile robots must have some source of input data, some way of decoding that input, and a way of taking actions (including its own motion) to respond to a changing world. The need to sense and adapt to an unknown environment requires a powerful cognition system. Nowadays, there are mobile robots that can walk, run, jump, and so on like their biological counterparts. Several fields of robotics have arisen, such as wheeled mobile robots, legged robots, flying robots, robot vision, artificial intelligence, and so on, which involve different technological areas such as mechanics, electronics, and computer science. In this article, the world of mobile robots is explored including the new trends. These new trends are led by artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, network communication, cooperative work, nanorobotics, friendly humanâ€“robot interfaces, safe humanâ€“robot interaction, and emotion expression and perception. Furthermore, these news trends are applied to different fields such as medicine, health care, sports, ergonomics, industry, distribution of goods, and service robotics.
