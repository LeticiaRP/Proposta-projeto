        In this work, we present the \textit{Sir Galahad} project, a two-wheeled balancing robot that incorporates advanced concepts in robotics and dynamic systems control. The central objective of this project is to develop a robot capable of maintaining its balance while navigating diverse environments and accurately targeting predefined objectives.

        The pursuit of autonomous and versatile solutions in robotics has driven the development of systems that can interact intricately with their surroundings. The \textit{Sir Galahad} project serves as an illustration of how the integration of complex technologies can yield a system akin to the balance of an inverted pendulum.
        
        Throughout this work, we will introduce the project's functional and non-functional requirements, along with our approach to developing this robot over the course of the semester. We will outline expected materials and methods, as well as potential risks and corresponding action plans.
